# Reactive Swift 4 Programming [Video]
This is the code repository for [Reactive Swift 4 Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/reactive-swift-4-programming-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787124745), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The Reactive approach will help you to write clean, cohesive, resilient, scalable, and maintainable code.Rx Swift belongs to a large family of Rx implementations in different programming languages that all share an almost identical syntax and semantics. We will introduce you to the world of Reactive programming, primarily focusing on mobile platforms. We tell you how you can benefit from using Rx Swift in your projects, existing or new.

We are going to build a simple application that allows people to look up any movie and add it to a favourites list. With this app we will be able to utilize RxSwift to react in real-time to any business logic that could be done through server-side with Google Firebase.

The course will demonstrate how unbelievably easy it is to configure asynchronous behavior and other app aspects that are traditionally considered to be hard to implement and maintain. It explains what Rx is made of, and how to switch to the Reactive way of thinking to get the most out of it.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This video course targets developers familiar with Swift 4.0 and iOS development in general who have experienced the perils of building apps and are keen to reduce unnecessary complexity in their apps.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
A solid state drive. You'll be miserable with a spinning disk.
Lots of RAM. 8 or 16 GB is best.
Lots of screen space. Even the 12" or 13" sizes are a bit cramped.
